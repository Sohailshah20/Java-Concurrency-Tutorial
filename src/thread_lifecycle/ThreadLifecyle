States of a thread

1. New state - A new instance of a thread is created

2. Runnable State - When the start method is called on a thread,it enters a runnable state.
    It technically enters the run state but when the thread is going to start running is
    decided by the thread scheduler of the underlying operating system. When the thread scheduler
    have resources to for the thread the thread actually starts running.

3. Running State - In this state the thread is in running

4. Blocked/Waiting State - The thread is blocked by monitor lock or other thread or waiting for a resource.

5. Terminated State - The thread is in terminated state when it stops running.

NOTE:
Remember the JVM does not control the execution of the threads.
Itâ€™s managed the underlying operating systems Thread Scheduler. The JVM only acts as bridge.
